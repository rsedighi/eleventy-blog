Hey, this journal aka blog is intended for me as I learn and capture my thoughts. I lose paper, and don't free flow as quickly when I write with pen and paper, so blogging online it is. I like how Shawn Wang (@swyx) uses his blog to capture his learnings along the way. For now, the most exciting thing is this 11ty blog with Netlify CMS. 

I want to understand how this blog was built, I'm sure there are videos on it.
